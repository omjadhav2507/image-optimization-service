Project Approach: On-the-Fly Image Optimization

_Objective_: Implement a solution for on-the-fly image optimization to enhance application performance by reducing image file sizes without compromising quality.

1. Project Overview

_Purpose_: Integrate automatic image optimization to improve loading times and user experience for uploaded images.

2. Key Features

_Image Upload_: Provide an endpoint for uploading images to be optimized.

_Image Optimization_: Automatically optimize uploaded images based on predefined parameters.

_Supported Formats_: Support optimization for JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats.

_Configuration_: Allow customization of optimization parameters such as format conversion, resizing (width), and quality settings.

_Security_: Implement basic authentication to secure the optimization endpoint.

_Error Handling_: Centralize error handling to manage and respond to image upload and optimization failures gracefully.
